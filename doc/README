-- Description

   tspawn.sh is a basic helper script intended to simplify spawning of tmux
   sessions based on static config files.  Think of it as an even simpler
   version of tmuxinator with no Ruby/YAML dependencies.  Much of what this
   helper script does can be achieved with an even simpler bash script,
   but the methods necessary to name panes as they're created was inelegant
   and unwieldy, so this resolves that will also making configuration of new
   sessions less painful and more concise.
  
   Tspawn expects a corresponding XML file matching the argument passed, then
   extracts window names, pane names, layout preferences, and commands
   accordingly.  From there, it should spawn the necessary tmux session of
   the same name, spawn expected windows and panes, and pass commands.

   At present, the one thing I didn't include that is relatively easy to do
   with a raw bash script was manually pre-designate percentages and split
   directions of panes.  I could code tspawn to do it, but I'd already gotten
   into the habit with my bash script equivalents of just spawning panes at
   arbitrary default percentages and then invoking a "tmux set-layout" command
   per window after each one was done, so the added complexity to make it
   happen didn't feel justified.  I may revisit that another time, though.

-- Prereqs

   bash
   tmux
   xmllint (usually included in your distro's xmllib2 package)
   xmlstarlet with xpath support

-- Requirements

   By default, tspawn.sh expects to live in ~/.config/tspawn/, but you can
   tailor it easily to an alternative location of your choosing by changing the
   value of BASE.  An XML file of the same name as the first argument passed to
   the script (sans the .xml extension) is likewise expected.
   
   DTD validation is performed against the matching XML file prior to session
   creation to insure its contents are in proper order and all needed values
   are present.  

-- Installation

   1) Clone into your ~/.config/ dir
   2) cd ~/.config/tspawn/doc
   3) cp example.xml ../cfg/sometmuxsessionname.xml
   2) Tailor sometmuxsessionname.xml to your needs
   3) Add a sometmuxsessionname alias to your shell's rc
   4) ???
   5) Profit

-- Example Usage

   > ~/.config/tspawn/tspawn.sh admin

   Or:

   > cat 'alias admin="~/.config/tspawn/tspawn.sh admin"' >> ~/.zsh/aliases
   > cat 'alias dev="~/.config/tspawn/tspawn.sh dev"' >> ~/.zsh/aliases
   > . ~/.zshrc

   > admin
   > dev

-- TODO:

   1) Enable the ability for the config to tell tmux to clear panes after creation (ie make use of clear="yes")
   2) Fix bug that's not properly spawning all panes
